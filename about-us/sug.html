                <h4>A grain is a small, hard, dry edible fruit or seed harvested for human or animal consumption. They are a fundamental part of the global diet, providing essential carbohydrates, protein, and vitamins. </h4>
            <h2>Key Points:</h2>
            <h4>Types: Grains are broadly divided into two categories:</h4>
            Cereal grains (true grains) are members of the grass family and include wheat, rice, corn (maize), barley, oats, and rye.
            Pseudocereals are non-grass plants that produce grain-like seeds, such as quinoa, buckwheat, and amaranth.

            <h4> Value: Grains are a primary source of energy-giving carbohydrates. Whole grains (containing the bran, germ, and endosperm) are particularly nutritious, offering significant amounts of fiber, B vitamins, and minerals. Refined grains have the bran and germ removed, which reduces their nutritional content.</h4>

            <h4>Storage and Trade: Due to their small, hard, and dry nature, grains are durable and can be stored and transported easily, making them a major global agricultural commodity.</h4>

            <h4>Uses: Grains are versatile and used in numerous ways:</h4>

            <h4>Food: They are cooked whole, or ground into flour for making breads, pasta, and cakes.</h4>

            <h4>Animal Feed: Large quantities of grains, particularly corn, are used as feed for livestock and poultry.</h4>

            <h4>Industrial Products: Grains are also used to produce various industrial substances, including alcohols and vegetable oils</h4>
